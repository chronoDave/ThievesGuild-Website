# Thesis

#### What

During this thesis we, Danilo van den Beemt & David Wolters, will be exploring storytelling within the medium video games We are of the opinion that storytelling within video games falls short on its potential. Video games differentiate themselves from other media such as books and film by means of interactivity. When playing a video game I, the player, have an effect on the events on the screen, though this control doesn't necessarily translate to the story within the game.

Stories within games often exist solely to give context to the player's actions. This context can vary from a few lines on the back of the box to a wiki full of stories about the characters and world of the game. Despite the size of the story, the freedom of the player to interact with the story is limited to the choices offered by the developers.

Our main question (as of 03/03/2020) is:

> #### How can 'play don't tell' be used in video games to convey narrative more naturally?

This question summarizes the general direction of our thesis. We personally believe that the question isn't yet good enough, and will be improved throughout our thesis.

#### Why

In the last few years, with the increase of computer power, an industry trend has emerged. The trend of the "Cinematic Game". Games such as Uncharted (2007), God of War (2018) and Tomb Raider (2013). These games try to imitate and translate the bombastic Hollywood movies into games. As a player you navigate from one action scene to another in order to continue the story. This form / genre of games focuses on the story and characters and, just like in movies, use them as the main source of motivation for the player.

Ian Bogost, an American scholar and game designer, believes that games are better without a story:

 > *The best interactive stories are still worse than even middling books and movies. That's a problem to be ignored rather than solved"[1]*

The culprit, according to Bogost, is the way games tell their stories:

 > *"One shortcut is an approach called environmental storytelling. Environmental stories invite players to discover and reconstruct a fixed story from the environment itself. (...) *

 > *The approach raises many questions. Are the resulting interactive stories really interactive, when all the player does is assemble something from parts? Are they really stories, when they are really environments? And most of all, are they better stories than the more popular and proven ones in the cinema, on television, and in books?"[1]*

Although we agree with the arguments that underpin Bogost's position, we don't agree with his point of view. Video games as a medium for storytelling are still very young, to say that games will never match traditional media (books or movies) is a pessimistic view of the future.

According to many theorists, the future of interactive storytelling looks like the Holodeck from Star Trek. The Holodeck is a fictional multi-sensory, three-dimensional, interactive virtual space that allows the participant to play a role in a story that is generated live based on the unpredictable interactions between the participant and the Holodeck.

A proponent of this future is Professor Janet Murray. In her book "Hamlet on the Holodeck" Murray writes:

 > *"The Holodeck, like any literary experience, is potentially valuable in exactly this way. It provides a safe place in which to confront disturbing feelings we would otherwise suppress; it allows us to recognize our most threatening fantasies without becoming paralyzed by them "*[2].

At the end of her book Murray writes:

 > *"Narrative beauty is independent of medium"[2].*

Scholar Marie-Laure Ryan interprets this statement in her article "The Case of Narrative in Digital Media" in two different ways:

 > *"This statement can be interpreted in two ways, one that I find profoundly true, and the other profoundly false. The false interpretation claims that since narrativity is a cognitive pattern or mental representation independent of medium, all media are equally adept at representing a given plot. (...)*
 
 > *This interpretation not only ignores the idiosyncrasies of each medium, it also assumes all too quickly that what digital technology adds to existing media is necessarily a dimension that enhances narrativity. The other interpretation, the one that I endorse, says that the abstract cognitive structure we call narrative is such that it can be called to mind by many different media, but each medium has different expressive resources, and will therefore produce different concrete manifestation of this abstract structure. (...)*
 
 > *The question, then, is to decide which types of stories are suitable for digital media."[3]*

Ryan doubts whether the Holodeck is realistically feasible both from a technical and psychological point of view. On the technical side, big steps will have to be taken in the field of AI to be able to generate stories based on the unpredictable actions and reactions of the participants. Even if these technological obstacles are overcome, the question remains how satisfactory playing a character within a story will be. Participants of a "Holonovel" are co-producer of the story but above all should be the beneficiary of the story. Players of games and sports participate in the activity for their entertainment, becoming a character within a "Holonovel" should be a self rewarding experience.

It is unclear whether the Holodeck is really the future of any interactive media that tells a story. We believe that the Holodeck will become an entirely separate medium should the technological obstacles be overcome. The creation of a completely individual story will be an entirely different experience than the experience of a traditional story, independent of medium.

This does not mean that the concept of a Holodeck is not relevant to games. Natural interpersonal communication is central to the Holodeck, which is something video games can learn a lot from. In traditional games, information is transferred many times through dialogue. Dialogue in video games is static, when the player is given the choice to participate in the dialogue, they are given the choice from a list of potential answers.

#### How

PHASE 1 of our thesis is dedicated to developing our opinions on the subject, by means of desk and literature research. We mapped out the views of the different parties in the debate on interactive story telling, which allowed us to develop our own arguments and point of view.

A market analysis was also done; The most popular / successful games between 1995 and 2019 were collected and sorted by popularity, genre, rating and year of publication[4].

This market analysis visualizes supply and demand and makes it clear that roughly over the past 25 years games with a strong emphasis on story are the most popular[4].

#### Conclusion

Opinions about interactive storytelling are very divided within ludology. According to many scholars, games will never match traditional media in the field of storytelling, whilst other scholars say that it is a matter of time and experimentation. In the debate between ludology and narratology we join the narratologists. We believe that a story, when properly applied, can elevate a game to a better, more emotional experience.

> Our current hypothesis is that a theoretically perfect form of interactive storytelling arises when both the player and the game exercise balanced control over the narrative[4].

With the knowledge and point of view we now possess, it is up to us to prove that an interactive story can actually exist in a video game. In order to find out how stories within games can differentiate themselves with stories within traditional media, research will have to be done into different types of stories and story methods. The results will be translated and processed into an interactive design that will support our hypothesis.
